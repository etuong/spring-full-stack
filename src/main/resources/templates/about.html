            <p>BookSmart is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores. We
                believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. Theyâ€™re where authors can connect with
                readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last
                a lifetime.</p>
            <p>If you are an author, a website or magazine, have a bookclub, an organization that wants to recommend
                books, or even just a book-lover with an Instagram feed, you can sign up to be an affiliate, start your
                own shop, and be rewarded for your advocacy of books. Bookshop wants to give back to everyone who
                promotes books, authors, and independent bookstores!</p>
        </div>
        <p>By design, we give away over 75% of our profit margin to stores, publications, authors and others who make up
            the thriving, inspirational culture around books! BookSmart is your one way stop to show for books, the
            smart way!</p>
